# Common Unity Samples

This project contains samples to showcase [Common Unity Library](https://github.com/m039/CommonUnityLibrary). 

[You can try them in a browser](http://m039.github.io/CommonUnitySamples). 

Samples:
* [GOAP sample](/Assets/Projects/GOAPSample)
* [Behaviour tree sample](/Assets/Projects/BehaviourTreeSample)
* [State machine sample](/Assets/Projects/StateMachineSample)

## GOAP Sample

This sample is inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhnlNKWh7oc&t=480s) about GOAP in Godot. I used the same goals and assets. The main goal of a bot is to keep a bonfire lit. He can also be hungry or in danger when he encounteres a troll.

## Behaviour Tree Sample

In this sample there are several types of bots with different behaviours. From time to time some food appears and bots are trying to find and grab it. You can also add or remove food by clicking on the screen.

## State Machine Sample

This is a very simple sample when you can change a bot's state by pressing a button.
